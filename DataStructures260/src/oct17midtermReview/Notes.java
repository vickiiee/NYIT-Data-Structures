	 * 
	 * Ch2 Arrays 
	 * • The Basics of Arrays in Java (search, insert, delete) 
	 * • Java Code for an Ordered Array (searching: linear, binary) (noDups()) 
	 * • Logarithms (how many steps are required to binary search and array of 1000 (N) elements?) 
	 * 		>Check out Zybooks 2.2
	 * 		>Binary Search: [log2 (N) + 1] = number of STEPS required if cannot find the search element. 
	 * 						[log2 (N)] = number of elements checked if cannot find the search element
	 * 		>Linear Search: N times if cannot find the search element
	 * • Big O Notation (Running Time in Big O Notation)
	 * 
	 * Ch3 Simple sorting 
	 * • Bubble Sort (77 99 44 55 show the steps) 
	 * • Selection Sort (same) 
	 * • Insertion Sort (same)
	 * 
	 * Ch4 Stacks and Queues (with arrays) 
	 * • (12 3 4 * 5 * * 9 * 10) Numbers mean a push on a stack and * means a pop. What is the final stack? 
	 * • (12 3 4 * 5 * * 9 * 10) Numbers mean a add to a queue and * means remove. What is the final queue? 
	 * • Stacks (write a stack class with array/link list) 
	 * • Queues (write a queue class with array/link list) 
	 * • Priority Queues 
	 * • Given a partial class, write constructor, remove(), peek(), isEmpty(), isFull(), traverse() + other methods.
	 * 
	 * Ch 5 Linked Lists 
	 * • Links 
	 * • A Simple Linked List 
	 * • Finding and Deleting Specified Links 
	 * • Double-Ended List 
	 * • Doubly-Linked List 
	 * • Given a partial class, write constructor, insertFirst(), deleteFirst(),, insertLast(), deleteLast(), find() , displayList() , traverse() + other methods.
	 * 
	 * Ch6 Recursion
