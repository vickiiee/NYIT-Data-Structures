 * Minimum Spanning Tree with Weighted Graphs
When all edges are the same weight, it’s fairly straightforward—
as we saw earlier—for the algorithm to choose one to add to
the minimum spanning tree. But when edges can have
different weights, some arithmetic is needed to choose the
right one.,

******************important****
krusgal's algorithm:
consider adding edges based on weight, unless it creates a cycle: slide 137

prims algorithm: like breadth first search, look at adjacent vertexes first. if it is the shortest then add it into graph.
