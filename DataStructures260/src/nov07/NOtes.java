	 * CH 13 graphs: Zybooks: A graph is a data structure for representing
	 * connections among items, and consists of vertices connected by edges.
	 * 
	 * A vertex (or node) represents an item in a graph. 
	 * An edge represents a connection between two vertices in a graph.
	 * 
	 * In a graph:

Two vertices are adjacent if connected by an edge.
A path is a sequence of edges leading from a source (starting) vertex to a destination (ending) vertex. The path length is the number of edges in the path.
The distance between two vertices is the number of edges on the shortest path between those vertices.
